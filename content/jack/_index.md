# COVID-19 and Hygiene
* Please wash hands after returning from outside, before touching Jack.
* Avoid crowded places
* No kissing (for non family members)

# Feeding
Jack is pretty good at letting you know when he is hungry. When he is not happy
feeding him is generally the first thing to try.

* No known allergies
* Formula goes bad very quickly. It cannot be out unrefrigerated for more than
  2 hours and cannot last in the fridge more than 48 hours. Expired formula
  should be dumped.
* During the day he will generally eat every 2-3 hours
* Jack is starting to eat solid foods. Currently he can eat pureed vegetables
  and single grain cereal (rice or oatmeal).
* He may take a bottle to supplement the solid food.
* We try to give him 3 meals per day of solid food. Typically 10am, 1pm, and
  5pm.

# Sleeping and Napping
* Bed time is at 8pm, wake up time is around 7am.
* Naps are typically twice a day for up to 2 hours at a time.
* He often cat naps and will only stay down for 20-30 minutes. These are better
  than missing naps. Missing naps will result in more interrupted sleep at
  night.
* First nap is usually around 10-11am
* Second nap is usually around 3-4pm
* We are trying to sleep train Jack currently. Generally he is a very good
  sleeper. If he fusses try to let him soothe himself for about 5 minutes. If he
  does not stop you can go in and try to give him his pacifier. Stroking his
  head and lightly restraining him to stop slapping and kicking can help calm
  him. Picking him up and feeding him is the last resort.
* Feeding him while rocking has never not put him back to sleep for us.

## Bedtime Routine
* He gets a bath and a ~8oz bottle before bed. If you start drawing the bath
  around 7pm by the time you bathe, feed, and rock him to sleep it should be bed
  time.
* When sleeping at night he can go the full time (12 hours) without food.

## Snoo
Jack currently sleeps in a [Snoo](https://happiestbaby.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)
bassinet. The Snoo helps us monitor his sleep and rock him when he fusses, often
lulling him back to sleep on its own.

To use it spread out the sleep sack. Place jack in the middle of the sack.
Velcro the two wings across his chest and over one arm. Thread the free arm (he
seems to prefer his left arm free) through the hole near the shoulder. Zip the
sack all the way up to the neck.  You can pull down on the sack if the zipper
seems too tight on his neck.

Press the button at the foot of the Snoo once to turn it on, it will turn blue.
Optionally press and hold the button one more time to increase rocking and sound
to help put him to sleep at the start.

If you need help figuring out how to get jack into the sack see this
[video](https://happiestbaby.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/231640327-Putting-Baby-in-SNOO-Sack-Video-Tutorial-).
Note that the video shows putting the baby in the sack outside the Snoo, then
placing him into the bassinet. This is not necessary, but can be useful if you
are having trouble putting him down without waking up. You can put him in the
sack, rock him to sleep, then put in pre-bundled into the Snoo.

If the button flashes white when pressed it means the sleep sack is not properly
attached to the base. Make sure the two thin sleeves are hooked onto the clips
at the sides of the matress.

If Jack fusses the Snoo will slowly turn itself up, rocking more and playing
louder sounds as it does. It will turn itself down after he calms down. You can
turn it down yourself if you have the phone app, otherwise turn it off then on
to set it back to the lowest level.

If Jack fusses enough the Snoo will give up rocking, the light will turn red,
and will send alerts to anyone with the phone app. Turn the Sonn off and on to
reset it.

# Changing
* Wipe thoroughly, including in all the folds of skin between legs and around
  testicles.
* Watch for rashing around anus and testicles. If inflamed apply zinc ointment
  and let us know.
* Do not peel back penis foreskin and wipe. This hurts him a lot, and can cause
  irritation of the glans.
* Jack currently (11/2020) wears size 3 diapers
* Do not leave him on top of the changing table unattended
