[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) is an awesome static site generator written in
rust. As part of the Zola you can generate a staticly generated search index. It
is up to you to display the search results on your site. Here I am offering a
dead simple solution that should work for most sites and templates. I am
currently using the [Hyde](https://github.com/getzola/hyde) theme for Zola until
inspiration (or boredom) strikes.
